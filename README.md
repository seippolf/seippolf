# Welcome
Hi, welcome to my GitHub page! I frequently update things on here, so thanks for stopping by.

# About Me
I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. In my free time I like watching Sci-Fi, Rubik's cubes,
and working on personal projects such as [my website](http://justinmjoh.com).

### Experience
I am versed in
* Python
* Web languages (JS, HTML, CSS)
* NodeJs + frameworks
 * Express
 * Mongoose
* MongoDB

### Where To Find Me
I can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinmjoh), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinmjoh/), and if you're into recursion, [GitHub](https://github.com/seippolf).

# Why Can't I See Your (Recent) Commits?
Most of my recent commits are held in private repos, since they are assignments for classes. Any repository that I feel contains information that will either solve
or greatly assist in solving an assignment will be kept private indefinitely.

### I Am an Instructor or Employer
If you feel it pertinent that you see commits kept privately, please reach out to me.
